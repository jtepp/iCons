> A new solution for the Queen's University iCons service


The iCons service at Queen's University consists of a group of student volunteers who run a rental service.
Things from paper, to chargers, to textbooks, can all be rented through the iCons.

As part of the APSC 100/103 course, our group was tasked with creating a more efficient, accessible, online solution for improving this service.

We produced this Android app, as well as an [iOS app](https://github.com/jtepp/iCons-iOS/) for use by all Queen's students.

We also created a [staff portal](https://github.com/jtepp/iconsportal) for managing the inventory and staff list.

The iCons site can be found [here](https://icon.engsoc.queensu.ca/).
